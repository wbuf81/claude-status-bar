# --- Signing / notarization ---
# Daisy ships as a Homebrew formula built from source, which needs NO signing identity: an app
# compiled on the user's own machine is never quarantined, so Gatekeeper has nothing to complain
# about. The ad-hoc fallback below is therefore the normal path, not a degraded one.
#
# The Developer ID branch is kept for the day we want a downloadable DMG, which WOULD need it — a
# downloaded ad-hoc app sends the user to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway.
# It needs, set up once on this Mac:
#   1. A "Developer ID Application" certificate in your keychain (Xcode > Settings > Accounts).
#   2. A notarytool credential profile:
#        xcrun notarytool store-credentials "daisy-statusbar" \
#          --apple-id you@example.com --team-id <your-team> --password <app-specific-password>
#
# TEAM_ID is OURS to set. It was W9JZ4932LA (upstream's team) — inherited by the fork, and a cert
# we could never hold, so every build silently fell through to ad-hoc. Empty means "no Developer ID
# expected", which is the honest state today.

# `|| true` so a missing Developer ID cert (grep matches nothing → nonzero, which `set -eo pipefail`
# would otherwise treat as a fatal error) falls through to the ad-hoc dev build below instead of
# aborting the whole script.
#
# The TEAM_ID guard is load-bearing: `grep ""` matches EVERY line, so an unset TEAM_ID would
# happily select some unrelated Developer ID cert from the keychain and sign Daisy with it.
